		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>Aegis was created for a simple purpose, to be an alternative for web developers, as simple as it could be and yet as complete and advanced as it could be as well. This means that it would be easy to use for both new and experienced developers, it also aims to help many others understand and learn about how a framework is built from scratch. Aegis takes advantage of all the newest technologies and best practices meaning that it's not for everyone, Aegis tries to be bleeding edge and that means it changes a lot.</p>
		<p>We all want awesome webs, with cool functionalities and design. Awesomeness needs time, so why not spend less time doing generic stuff and spend a lot more building the future?</p>
